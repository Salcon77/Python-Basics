#NUMBERS

#Python supports integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers. They are defined as int, float and
# complex class in Python.
a = 5
print(type(a))
b =5.0
print(type(b))
c = 5 + 3j
print(type(c+3))

#Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point. 5 is integer
# whereas 5.0 is a floating point number.
# While integers can be of any length, a floating point number is accurate only up to 15 decimal places
# (the 16th place is inaccurate).

#Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part.
