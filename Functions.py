# Functions
"""
In Python, function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.
Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger,
functions make it more organized and manageable.
Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes code reusable.

# A function name to uniquely identify it. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python.
