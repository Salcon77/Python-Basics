#PASS

"""
In Python programming, pass is a null statement. The difference between a comment and pass statement in Python is that,
while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.
However, nothing happens when pass is executed. It results into no operation (NOP).

# pass is just a placeholder for
# functionality to be added later.

# We can do the same thing in an empty function or class as well.
